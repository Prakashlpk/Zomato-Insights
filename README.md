# 🍽️ Zomata - Food Delivery Data Insights Using Python and SQL

## 🧩 Project Overview
This project simulates a food delivery analytics system inspired by Zomato. The main objective is to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction by building an interactive system that manages and analyzes food delivery data using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Features
- Streamlit-based data entry and analysis interface
- OOP-based Python backend for SQL operations
- Supports dynamic schema changes (add columns/tables)
- Synthetic dataset generation using `Faker`
- 20+ insightful SQL queries for business analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- MySQL / TiDB
- Streamlit
- Faker Library
- SQL
- Jupyter / Google Colab

## 📁 Functional Modules
### 1. Dataset Creation
- Synthetic data generation for customers, restaurants, orders, deliveries

### 2. Database Design
- 5 SQL tables: `customer_table`, `restaurants_table`, `orders_table`, `deliveries_table`, `delivery_person_table`

### 3. Streamlit Interface *(optional extension)*
- Add, update, delete records dynamically
- Visualize insights and query outputs

### 4. SQL Insights
- Peak order times and locations
- Delayed and canceled deliveries
- Customer behavior analytics
- Delivery performance
- Restaurant popularity

## 🔍 Sample SQL Insights
- Top 5 customers by number of orders
- Average delivery delay by restaurant
- Order count by preferred cuisine
- On-time vs delayed delivery comparison
- Revenue trends by location

## 📊 Project Structure
- `zomato_code.txt`: Python class and code to create tables, insert data, and perform SQL operations
- `problem_statement.txt`: Complete description of schema, use cases, and expected outcomes

## 📈 Results
- Functional OOP-based Python system
- Fully normalized SQL schema
- Interactive backend with dynamic table operations
- Insights generation using 20+ SQL queries
